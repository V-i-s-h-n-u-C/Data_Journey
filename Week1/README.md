# 🧠 Week 1 — QA Bug Analysis (SQL + Python + Power BI)

### 🎯 Objective
This project marks the beginning of my transition from **QA Engineer → Data Analyst → Data Scientist**.  
The goal for Week 1 was to analyze QA bug data using **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI** — mirroring a real-world data analysis workflow.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
A synthetic QA bug dataset was generated using **Mockaroo** and analyzed across multiple stages:
1. **SQL** — Data cleaning, aggregation, and relational joins  
2. **Python (EDA)** — Statistical and visual exploration of bug trends  
3. **Power BI** — Building an interactive dashboard to communicate insights  

Each stage builds upon the previous one, resulting in a complete end-to-end data analysis pipeline.

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **SQL (MySQL)** | Querying, joins, and aggregations |
| **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** | Data cleaning & exploratory data analysis |
| **Power BI** | Dashboard creation & KPI visualization |
| **Mockaroo** | Synthetic dataset generation |
| **DAX** | Calculated KPIs in Power BI |

## 📈 Dashboard Overview
The **Power BI dashboard** brings together key metrics for QA performance and software quality:

### Visuals
- 🧩 **Bug Count by Module & Severity**  
- 📊 **Status Distribution (Open, Closed, In Progress, Resolved)**  
- 🧮 **KPI Cards:** Open Bugs, % Critical Bugs, Avg Resolution Days  
- 👨‍💻 **Employee Performance** (Critical bugs handled, resolution rates)  
- ⏱️ **Average Resolution Time by Module**

## 🔍 Key Insights
- The **Login** and **Payment** modules reported the highest number of bugs.  
- Around **23%** of total bugs were **Critical**, concentrated in specific modules.  
- The **average resolution time** was approximately **16 days**.  
- **Employee Alice** resolved the most critical issues.  
- Severity and resolution time showed a strong correlation.
