# 🧠 Week 2 & 3 — Software Quality Analysis (SQL + Power BI + DAX)

### 🎯 Objective
Weeks 2 & 3 focused on exploring software quality metrics using **SQL and Power BI**.  
The dataset was downloaded from **Kaggle** and includes attributes such as bug density, code coverage, maintainability index, commits, and technical debt.

The goal was to analyze overall software quality and build **interactive dashboards** to compare languages, frameworks, and cloud platforms.

## 📊 Project Overview

### SQL Analysis
- Data profiling and summary exploration  
- Bug Density and Maintainability comparisons  
- Language-wise and framework-wise quality metrics  
- Technical Debt evaluation  
- Cloud provider impact on Code Coverage  
- Identification of highest & lowest quality projects  

### Power BI Dashboards
Two dashboards were created:

#### 1. Software Quality Metrics Dashboard
- Quality Score, Bug Density, Maintainability KPIs  
- Quality Trends by Programming Language  
- Framework-wise Quality Score  
- Technical Debt per Language  
- Lines of Code distribution  

#### 2. Deep Dive Dashboard
- Best and worst quality projects  
- Maintainability vs Quality Score analysis  
- Cloud coverage comparison  
- Project-level summary table  

### DAX Measures
- Average Bug Density  
- Average Maintainability Index  
- Average Code Coverage  
- Average Quality Score  
- Technical Debt Category Classification

## 📈 Key Insights
- Python, JavaScript, and R show higher overall Quality Scores.  
- Frameworks like Flask, Django, and React demonstrate strong maintainability.  
- Technical Debt is higher for low-level languages such as C and MATLAB.  
- High commit frequency tends to align with better quality.  
- Cloud platforms such as Vercel, AWS, and GCP show stronger coverage patterns.
